Query: Scagnostics is a set of features that characterizes the data distribution in a scatterplot. These visual features have been used in various applications to detect unusual correlations of bivariate data. However, there is no formally published implementation for 3D or higher. This project aims to provide the Scagnostics implementation in JavaScript, called ScagnosticsJS, and also extend these measures for higher dimensional scattered points. We also present a Scagnostics exploration webpage, which makes the underlying algorithms transparent to users.

Query: Visualizing outliers in massive datasets requires statistical pre-processing in order to reduce the scale of the problem to a size amenable to rendering systems like D3, Plotly or analytic systems like R or SAS. This paper presents a new algorithm, called hdoutliers , for detecting multidimensional outliers. It is unique for a) dealing with a mixture of categorical and continuous variables, b) dealing with big-p (many columns of data), c) dealing with big-n (many rows of data), d) dealing with outliers that mask other outliers, and e) dealing consistently with unidimensional and multidimensional datasets. Unlike ad hoc methods found in many machine learning papers, hdoutliers is based on a distributional model that allows outliers to be tagged with a probability. This critical feature reduces the likelihood of false discoveries.

Query: This paper describes a visual interface for analyzing gene expression data generated from multiple biological samples under different controlled conditions. The tasks are to provide a comprehensive overview of thousands of genes under different states and to have an intuitive way to narrow down the set of genes with common behaviors. Our method involves using multidimensional projections and differential charts to help users can analyze different sets of data via a web-based interface. These charts incorporate into our final design successfully with other visual techniques to make the application accessible to genetics analysts, as demonstrated in the two use cases in plant and cancer researches. We further discuss the feedback from domain experts and the limitations of our approach to accommodate gene exploration tasks
